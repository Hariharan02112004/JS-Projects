In this project, I created a personal resume webpage built completely using HTML and CSS. Here's what the project includes:

Structured the entire resume content using semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.

Showcased personal details, education, skills, experience, projects, and contact information in a clean and organized layout.

Applied custom styling using CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the resume with proper spacing, fonts, and colors.

Made the layout responsive for different screen sizes using media queries to ensure usability across devices.

Used flexbox and grid layouts to align and arrange content for better readability and modern design aesthetics.

This project demonstrates how to create a well-organized, professional-looking resume web page using only HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, structure, and styling techniques.
