In this project, I created a simple interactive JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter their name and then displays it on the screen. Here's what the project includes:

Used the prompt() method to get the user's name.

Displayed the entered name dynamically using JavaScript.

Enhanced user interaction through simple and clean UI design.

This project demonstrates how to take user input through a dialog box and update the web page content based on that input using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
